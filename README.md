**Project 2 Nicholas Hillis**

### 1.) F2 implementation
   When run locally it takes 27 seconds with an estimate of 8567966130
   On the GCP it takes 63 seconds and estimates 8567966130


### 2. Tug-of-War
The tug of war when ran with width 10 and depth 3 
runs parallelized in 34 seconds with the following
 estimate 5677422246


### 3. BJKST
The BJKST Algorithm estimates 8670872 in 12 seconds when ran with size 3 and 5 trials


### 4. F0
F0 runs in 27 seconds and estimates 7406649.
BJKST runs much faster but is off by about 17% of the real value which means the BJKST performed well
Tug Of War Sketch ran slower than F2 and was off by a much larger margin of 34%. This proves that it was less efficient
than the BJKST with F0 but it is still a somewhat good way to estimate F2.
